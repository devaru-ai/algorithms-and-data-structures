# 1: The Basics (Frequency Counting & Lookups)
*These teach you how to set up a hash map, handle keys, and perform O(1) lookups.*

* **Two Sum** - The fundamental "complement" search.
* **Contains Duplicate**  - Basic existence checking.
* **Valid Anagram** - Frequency counting with strings.
* **Majority Element** - Counting occurrences to find a dominant element.
* **Intersection of Two Arrays** - Using Hash Sets for set theory operations.
* **First Unique Character in a String** - Two-pass hash map logic.
* **Ransom Note** - Comparing two frequency maps.

# 2: The "Prefix Sum" Pattern
*This is the most critical pattern for intermediate/advanced interviews. It uses a Hash Map to store cumulative sums to find subarrays efficiently.*

* **Subarray Sum Equals K**  - The most important problem in this category.
* **Contiguous Array**  - A variation using relative counts (+1/-1).
* **Continuous Subarray Sum**  - Handling remainders/modulo arithmetic in keys.
* **Path Sum III**  - Applying prefix sum logic to a Binary Tree.

# 3: Grouping and Isomorphism
*These teach you how to determine if two complex objects share a structure by mapping them to a common key.*

* **Group Anagrams**  - Requires hashing a sorted string or tuple as a key.
* **Isomorphic Strings**  - Requires two hash maps to track bidirectional mapping.
* **Word Pattern** - Mapping words to characters.
* **Find All Anagrams in a String** - Combining Hash Maps with the "Sliding Window" technique.

# 4: Design and System Structure
*These are often used in system design rounds or hard coding questions. They combine Hash Maps with other structures like Linked Lists or Arrays.*

* **Design HashMap**  - Building the tool from scratch (handling collisions).
* **LRU Cache**  - The ultimate test of Hash Map + Doubly Linked List integration.
* **Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)**  - Hash Map + Dynamic Array (ArrayList/Vector).
* **Time Based Key-Value Store** - Hash Map + Binary Search.

# Category 5: Geometry and Grids
*These teach you how to hash coordinate systems, slopes, or grid states.*

* **Valid Sudoku**  - Hashing based on row, column, and sub-box indices.
* **Max Points on a Line** - Hashing floating point slopes (or simplified fractions).
* **Number of Boomerangs**  - Hashing distances between points.

# 6: Advanced Sequence Logic
*Using Hash Maps/Sets to turn O(N log N) sorting problems into O(N) problems.*

* **Longest Consecutive Sequence**  - Using a Hash Set to find sequences without sorting.
* **Reconstruct Itinerary**  - Graph traversal using Hash Maps for adjacency lists.
