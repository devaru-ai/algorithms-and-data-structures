# Algorithms and Data Structures

| Data Structure     | Target Problems | Core Concepts |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Arrays & Strings   | 0/7             |Two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sums, in-place manipulation.              |
| Hash Tables        | 0/7             |Hashing, collision handling, `O(1)` average time complexity for lookup/insert/delete.              |
| Linked Lists       | 0/7             |Pointer management, traversal, reversal, cycle detection (Floyd's algorithm).              |
| Trees              | 0/7             |Traversal (BFS, DFS), recursion, BST properties, balanced trees.              |
| Graphs             | 0/7             |BFS and DFS traversal, topological sort, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford).              |
| Heaps              | 0/7             |Max/min heap properties, implementation with arrays, applications in priority queues and top-k problems.              |
| Stacks & Queues    | 0/7             |LIFO/FIFO principles, use in expression evaluation, and graph traversal.              |
